* Introduction

  in order to take reviews from a user, one of the most common method
  is to ask for ratings from the user. Thus, capturing ratings can be
  used as an important tool in ui-analytics.


* Implementation

  Implementing ratings on your own will require creating and handling
  database and dealing with many special cases. This can be bulky and
  tiresome to implement.

  Online world is full of websites which provide rating widgets. These
  widgets are highly customizable and can be moulded as per needs.One
  such website is [[widgetpack.com][widgetpack.com]]. API provided by the site can be
  directly included in the code to get rating widget implemented.
